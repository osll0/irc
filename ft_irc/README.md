## Description

ft_irc is a C++98 implementation of an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server. The project aims to create a fully functional IRC server that handles multiple clients simultaneously using non-blocking I/O operations. The server supports essential IRC commands, channel management, and private messaging, allowing users to connect using standard IRC clients.

## Instructions

### Compilation

```bash
make
```

### Running the Server

```bash
./ircserv <port> <password>
```

**Parameters:**

- `port`: The port number on which the server will listen for incoming connections
- `password`: The connection password required for clients to connect to the server

**Example:**

```bash
./ircserv 6667 mypassword
```

### Connecting to the Server

Use any standard IRC client (e.g., irssi, WeeChat, HexChat) to connect:

```bash
nc -C localhost 6667
nc -C 127.0.0.1 6667
```

### Clean up

```bash
make clean   # Remove object files
make fclean  # Remove object files and executable
make re      # Rebuild the project
```
